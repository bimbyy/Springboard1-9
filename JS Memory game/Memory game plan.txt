Clicking a card should change ht background color to be the color of the class it has
users should only be able to change at most two cards at a time
clicking on two matching cards should be a MATCH those cards stay face up
When clicking two cards that dont match they should stay for 1 more click then hide again (use setTimeout to execute code after 1 second)
